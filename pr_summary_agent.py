### REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT (Strictly adhere to this structure. Max 140 words total.)

### Summary
- 2–3 bullets detailing exact PR changes.

### Why It Matters
- Real reasoning based only on diff and security findings.

### Issues
- Synthesized list of real issues found in diff and tool output.

### Changes Required
- 1–2 essential fixes that need to be made before merging.

RULES:
- Do not output the markdown headers *inside* the bullet points.
- No hallucinations (use only diff and findings).
